# TrainScheduler
<p>A train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. This app will retrieve and manipulate information with Moment.js, and provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.</p>

<p>It is assumed that this Train Scheduler app is used for adding train data for a train that's already started/in transit (i.e., user cannot enter value in "First Train Time" field that's greater than the current time).</p>
